# RideAlog
## A terrible name for a learning project.

RideAlog is my first foray into iOS development. It's a routing app. 
It traces out the routes you take, saves them to date, and lets you view
them at a later date. I'll probably add an export function at some
point, maybe some web connectivity stuff, maybe a direction deal. Not
sure yet. For now, it's just me playing around with iOS.
